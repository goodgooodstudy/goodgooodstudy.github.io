## raining

Memory is a wonderful thing. If you don't have to deal with the past.

有些人的相遇，要等到整个世界都消失了风景，要等到时光也停止了流淌，等到岁月的纹路爬满了沧桑的脸庞，等到本来健步如飞的身体在时光痕迹中被雕刻出佝偻的模样。而有的人的相遇，要等到就连梦想也随着一天一天瞬息游动的白云逐渐的消散，要等到草木枯荣了几十个记不得年头的季节，要等到花瓣飘飞成了融雪，要等到记忆中的那个人在漫长而遥远的道路前方逐渐改变了容颜，残留下来回忆里略带了温暖的笑容。


The road not taken


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I tool the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.
